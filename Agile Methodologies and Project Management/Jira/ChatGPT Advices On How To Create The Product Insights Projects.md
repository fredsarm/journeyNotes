### 1. **Initial Setup of the Jira Project**

#### a. Create the Project in Jira
If you haven’t set up the Jira project yet, follow these steps to create a new project:

1. In Jira, click on **"Create Project"**.
2. Choose the project type that best fits your workflow. I recommend using **"Kanban"** or **"Scrum"** depending on how you prefer to organize and visualize your progress:
   - **Kanban**: Great for a continuous flow of tasks, where tasks move from "To Do" to "In Progress" and "Done".
   - **Scrum**: Useful if you prefer to work in sprints, setting time blocks to complete certain tasks.
3. Name your project, such as **"Product Insights"**.
4. Set up permissions if you want to give other users read-only access to follow your project.

### 2. **Create Main Tasks (Epics or Stories)**

Let’s start by creating main tasks that represent the major blocks of the project. These could be broken down as:

- **Database Modeling**
- **API Integration**
- **Data Analysis**
- **User Interface**
- **Documentation & Maintenance**

In Jira, you can add these as *Epics* or *Stories*.

#### Example of a Main Task:
- **Title**: "Database Modeling"
  - **Description**: Create the initial database structure, model tables, and define necessary relationships for vehicle data, attributes, and versions.
  - **Task Type**: Epic (or Story, depending on how you want to organize it)

#### Another Main Task:
- **Title**: "API Integration"
  - **Description**: Develop and integrate APIs to interact with the database, enabling queries for information like maintenance data and resale costs.
  - **Task Type**: Epic

You can follow this pattern for the other areas of the project.

### 3. **Gradually Add Subtasks and Sub-Subtasks**

As you work on each main task, you can create subtasks to break down larger blocks into smaller, more manageable pieces. For example:

#### Subtasks for "Database Modeling":
- **Title**: "Create brands table"
  - **Description**: Model the table that will store vehicle brand information.
  - **Task Type**: Subtask
- **Title**: "Define relationships between versions and attributes"
  - **Description**: Implement foreign keys and relationships to associate car versions with their attributes.
  - **Task Type**: Subtask

#### Subtasks for "API Integration":
- **Title**: "Develop maintenance data query endpoint"
  - **Description**: Create an endpoint to allow querying vehicle maintenance data.
  - **Task Type**: Subtask
- **Title**: "Implement authentication"
  - **Description**: Implement a secure authentication system to access the API.
  - **Task Type**: Subtask

### 4. **Track and Adjust in Jira**

With these main tasks and subtasks in place, you can:
- **Track progress**: Moving tasks through your Kanban or Scrum board, from "To Do" to "In Progress" and "Done".
- **Add more details**: As new needs arise, you can create additional subtasks or even sub-subtasks to manage smaller steps.

### 5. **Reports and Evidence for Monitoring**

Once you have several tasks and subtasks, Jira allows you to generate **progress reports** and **burndown charts** (in Scrum) to visualize the project's development. These reports can be useful for people who are monitoring your project, giving them a clear view of how you're managing the workflow.

### 6. **Permissions and Read-Only Access**

Finally, to give read-only access to others who want to see how you're using Jira:

1. Go to your project's settings in Jira.
2. Under the **"People"** section, add the users you want to grant access to.
3. Set their permission level to **"Read Only"**, so they can follow the project but not make changes.

---

### Next Steps
- Set up the project in Jira with the main tasks.
- Add details progressively as the development advances by adding subtasks and adjusting as necessary.
- Use visual reports to demonstrate your management skills in Jira.
